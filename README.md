Run sparkleCalibrate.m

## Directories
- imgs: contains images of various things along the way (mostly plots, etc, rather than actual glitter images)
- glitter_capturing_code: contains code for tasks relating to capturing glitter images, including but not limited to: remote control of our camera (to take images, adjust aperture and shutterspeed, etc), displaying lighting patterns on the monitor, and creating lighting-pattern images for displaying on the monitor.
- old: old code from throughout the project that might be useful for reference

## Glitter images
Actual glitter images used by this code are not stored in this repo for the sake of space
